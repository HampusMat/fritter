This release contains a major change - support for Nitter instances has been removed, and is now replaced with direct support for the Twitter API, using the same methods Nitter uses.

Support for Nitter was removed mainly so that the app doesn't DOS (abuse) public instances, and also due to development issues caused by differing data structures from all the different Nitter versions being hosted in the wild.

* Removed Nitter support in favour of using the Twitter API directly
